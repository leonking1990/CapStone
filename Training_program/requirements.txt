# Core Machine Learning Framework
tensorflow         # Includes Keras for model building, training, evaluation

# Numerical & Data Handling
numpy              # Foundational package for numerical computing
pandas             # Data analysis & manipulation (used in data/analysis scripts)

# Machine Learning Utilities & Evaluation
scikit-learn       # For metrics (e.g., confusion matrix) and data splitting

# Image Processing
Pillow             # For loading/manipulating images in helper scripts

# Data Visualization
matplotlib         # Plotting library for graphs (e.g., training history)
seaborn            # Statistical data visualization based on matplotlib

# Optional Dependencies (Uncomment if used in parts of your workflow not analyzed):
# opencv-python    # For advanced image processing/augmentation if needed
